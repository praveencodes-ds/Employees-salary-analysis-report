# Employee-salary-analysis-report
In this project we will write a long SQL query to analyze employee salary data and create a stunning report with 200+ lines of code and 10 CTEs.

## 1. Project Title/Headline

ðŸ“Š Employee Salary Analysis Report using SQL


---

## 2. Short Description/Purpose

This project analyzes employee salary progression over time, promotions, and departmental distribution using SQL. It helps HR and management teams track salary changes, identify promotion patterns, and evaluate workforce distribution.


---

## 3. Tech Stack

Database: MySQL / SQL Workbench

Language: SQL (DDL, DML, CTEs, Joins, Aggregations)

Tools (Optional): Power BI / Tableau / Excel (for visualization after SQL queries)



---

## 4. Data Source

Synthetic dataset created within SQL (employees and salary_history tables).

Employee details: employee_id, name, join_date, department.

Salary details: employee_id, change_date, salary, promotion.



---

## 5. Features/Highlights

âœ… Employee database creation with departments and joining dates.

âœ… Salary history tracking with promotions.

âœ… Use of CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for analysis.

âœ… Queries for:

Salary growth trends.

Employees promoted vs. not promoted.

Average salary by department.

Employee-wise salary progression over time.


âœ… Easy to extend with new employee/salary data.

## 6. Screenshots/Demos (Ideas for You to Add)

Since this is SQL-based, you can include:

Screenshot of the database schema (ER diagram of employees & salary_history).

Query execution screenshots from SQL Workbench.

Salary trend charts (export query results to Excel/Power BI/Tableau).

Example output tables (like employee salary growth over years).
